# Eclipse

This is a single-player only version of Eclipse, a board game that due to the name being a (relatively) common noun, and because it was published before the web was available outside universities, is impossible to find information on now. The best I can find is [the patent relating to the game board](https://www.google.com/patents/US3556526).

# Rules

(from the picture above, omitting parts that refer to example images)

The object of the game is to score as many 3-in-a-rows (A) Vertically (B) Diagonally (C) Horizontally as possible, while blocking  your opponent from doing the same. All 24 pieces are played before the score is counted.

Note: A piece can be a part of more than one 3-in-a-row. The strategy of the game is to make each piece a part of as many 3-in-a-rows as possible.

To start play, remove all balls from the pins. Each side takes a color. The side with the white balls makes the first play. One ball at a time is placed on any pin of the players's choice; each player placing a ball in turn until all the pins are full. Then count the score. Each 3-in-a-row counts one point â¸º highest score wins. <sup>*</sup>

Eclipse is played on a board of eight pins. The pins are arranged so that there are 6 interlocking alignments that provide 38 potential ways to score. A close game will generally run 6 to 5.


<sup>*</sup> Tie games that are "Mirror" ties are awarded to the first player. (Mirror ties occur when the second player imitates the first player's moves.)
